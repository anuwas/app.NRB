        <p>The Great Escape from India in 1941 was natural, logical and ultimate step in the development of netaji's programme of action to the final arnmed assault on Briitish imperalism. he planned the attack first from the northwest in keeping with traditional historical precedent. But when the inexorable course of events made this impossible, he re-planned the assault form the non-traditional direction, the northeast. To lead this assault,he was called upon to undertake ajourney under the sea which, in its originality, planning, execution and daring is unequalled in the world's military annals. The indian National Army rose under his leadership to knock out the basis of the British in the Indian subcontinent by supplanting the loyalty of the british Indian Army to its enslavers by the new loyalty to their country's freedom. Netaji and the INA achieved much more- they paved the way to the liberation of Southeast Asia by destroying the most vital instrument of colonial subjugation of the region, the British Indian Army. The Provisional Government of Azad Hind gave to the Indian people the frist experience of independent statehood after two centuries of servile existence.</p>
        <p>When the Second World War ended in 1945, the indian indepndence movement was at its lowest ebb. Defeatism and frustration gripped the nationnalist ranks as never before. At the crucial moment of history the shadow of a man descended on the indian stage like a colossus. Rarely, if ever, has one man- in absentia - commanded history thus and transformed an entier historical situation. Who dares question today that if, by sime chance, he had returned to India then, he wouid have carried everything before him and that if, by some chance, he had returned to India then, he would have carried everything before him and that the history of sub-continent would have taken a complelely different direction? NETAJI was no mere appellation- it was an assignment of history.</p>
        <p>In the current state of uncertainty in national affairs, needs to rediscover Subhas Chandra Bose. We need to remind ourselves of the messianic faith of this dedicated national revolutionary experiments across the world. The samyavada that Netaji was seeking meant for him a new alterntive. Even as a human being and thinker, he was seeking a new ethical conception in himan affairs. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was at once deeply involved in the spiritual heritage of india and actively concerned with the most modern social and and techonological advances anywhere in the world. His sense of mission did not admit of compromises and reservations. He sought to inspire his compatriots with the same dedication to the cause. In this he succeeded in a large measure and thus remains an example in leadership Let India rediscover Subhas Chandra Bose and, in his own words, " deliver to the world the message that has been her heritage though the past ages."</p>
